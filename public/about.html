<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>After completing sixth form, I took a gap year to travel extensively
across Asia, an experience that taught me valuable life lessons and
sparked a passion for travel. Since then, I have been fortunate to
explore many parts of the world.</p>

<p>On returning, I enrolled at Bournemouth University, where I am now
starting my second year of a BSc in Software Engineering.
In 2025, I undertook four weeks of international volunteering in
Poland and Malta, where I developed key skills in communication,
time management, mentoring, and leadership. Alongside my
studies, I have gained work experience in customer-facing roles,
including part-time positions in a local shop and McDonaldâ€™s, which
offered me flexibility during term breaks and helped me strengthen
my teamwork and interpersonal skills.</p>

<p>As I begin my second year at university, I am now seeking part time
employment to help subsidise my education while also gaining
further professional experience and transferable skills.</p>
